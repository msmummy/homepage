## Course information
Distributed systems help programmers aggregate the resource of many
networked computers to construct highly available and scalable services, such as
peta-byte storage, massively parallel computation. This class teaches the
abstractions, design and implementation techniques that allow you to build fast,
scalable, fault-tolerant distributed systems. Topics include multithreading,
network programming, consistency, naming, fault tolerance, and security and
several case studies of distributed systems. The course consists of lectures and
a series of programming labs.

## Prerequisites:
 * Undergraduate Operating Systems or Computer Systems Organization
 * System-level programming experience

## Useful Books
The following books may help provide background help. None of them are required.
They are listed in rough order of usefulness.
 * Principles of Computer System Design. Jerome Saltzer and M. Frans Kaashoek,
   Morgan Kaufmann.
 * Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms, Andrew Tanenbaum and Maarten
   van Steen, Prentice Hall.
