# Blockchain based Distributed Storage Networks (Filecoin) 

## Strawman: imply put all file datas into the blockchain
  * files are too large for everyone to validate
  * no incentives for nodes to store and share files
    * storage 
    * transmission 

## Fair exchange 
* impossible without a trusted party
* blockchain can work as a trusted party, e.g., smart contract 
* blockchain as a market
  * bid: Alice -> market 
  * ask: Bob -> market 
  * deal: Bob -> Alice -> k (within a time bound)
    * problem!
