# Revision History


## Oct 9, 2016 (before official release). 
Fixed many typos, nits and inconsistencies left in the design section due to many last-minute cut before camera-ready deadline. Changes are as follows:

* remove the extra line break in commit phase text.
* adjust format in pseudocode, use ``textit'' to remove extra spacing, use {\LAR} instead of $=$ for assignment.
* remove texts that imply there is a higher status type than {\sf committing}, i.e., the {\sf decided} status, which is cut from this version.
* make \textit{dep, ballot, status} three separate fields in text and pseudocode.
* correct spelling errors and other minor nits.
