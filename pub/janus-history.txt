# Revision History


## Oct, 2016 
Fixed many typos, nits and inconsistencies left in the design section due to many last-minute cut before camera-ready deadline. Changes are as follows:

* Remove the extra line break in commit phase text.
* Adjust format in pseudocode, use ``textit'' to remove extra spacing, use left arrow instead of $=$ for assignment.
* Remove texts that imply there is a higher status type than {\sf committing}, i.e., the {\sf decided} status, which is cut from this version.
* Make \textit{dep, ballot, status} three separate fields in text and pseudocode.
* Fix spelling errors and other minor nits.
* A formula in section 3.3 was updated to indicate when a recovery coordinator is guaranteed to observe conflicting transactions’ dependencies. The formula was $(\mathcal{F} \cap \mathcal{M}) \cap (\mathcal{F} \cap \mathcal{M}) \ne \emptyset $, changed to $(\mathcal{F} \cap \mathcal{M}) \cap (\mathcal{F’} \cap \mathcal{M’}) \ne \emptyset $. Extra prime symbols are added to clarify that they are not the same set.
* Fix other nits.

## Dec 2017
* Fix a typo in algorithm line 23; minor change on the algorithm 6 title.
